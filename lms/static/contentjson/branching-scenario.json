In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of printing, this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.[20]<\/p>\n\n<p>In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark,[21]&nbsp;play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.<\/p>\n"},"override":{"activeSurface":false,"hideSummarySlide":false,"enablePrintButton":false,"social":{"showFacebookShare":true,"facebookShare":{"url":"@currentpageurl","quote":"I scored @score out of @maxScore on a task at @currentpageurl."},"showTwitterShare":false,"twitterShare":{"statement":"I scored @score out of @maxScore on a task at @currentpageurl.","url":"@currentpageurl","hashtags":"h5p, course"},"showGoogleShare":false,"googleShareUrl":"@currentpageurl"},"summarySlideSolutionButton":true,"summarySlideRetryButton":true},"l10n":{"slide":"Slide","score":"Score","yourScore":"Your Score","maxScore":"Max Score","total":"Total","totalScore":"Total Score","showSolutions":"Show solutions","retry":"Retry","exportAnswers":"Export text","hideKeywords":"Hide keywords list","showKeywords":"Show keywords list","fullscreen":"Fullscreen","exitFullscreen":"Exit fullscreen","prevSlide":"Previous slide","nextSlide":"Next slide","currentSlide":"Current slide","lastSlide":"Last slide","solutionModeTitle":"Exit solution mode","solutionModeText":"Solution Mode","summaryMultipleTaskText":"Multiple tasks","scoreMessage":"You achieved:","shareFacebook":"Share on Facebook","shareTwitter":"Share on Twitter","shareGoogle":"Share on Google+","summary":"Summary","solutionsButtonTitle":"Show comments","printTitle":"Print","printIngress":"How would you like to print this presentation?","printAllSlides":"Print all slides","printCurrentSlide":"Print current slide","noTitle":"No title","accessibilitySlideNavigationExplanation":"Use left and right arrow to change slide in that direction whenever canvas is selected.","accessibilityCanvasLabel":"Presentation canvas.

The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art.<\/p>\n"},"subContentId":"c906047c-ec83-4b9a-ab0c-c6cc47e0a82f","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"}},"alwaysDisplayComments":false,"backgroundOpacity":0,"displayAsButton":false,"buttonSize":"big","goToSlideType":"specified","invisible":false,"solution":""},{"x":63.329928498468,"y":3.9525691699605,"width":28.907845965271,"height":73.519330434783,"action":{"library":"H5P.Image 1.1","params":{"contentName":"Image","file":{"path":"images\/file-5be88a837fa82.jpg","mime":"image\/jpeg","copyright":{"license":"U"},"width":220,"height":282}},"subContentId":"3f0f0f2d-e1e8-4525-bb6e-8aaab294333b","metadata":{"contentType":"Image","license":"U","title":"Untitled Image"}},"alwaysDisplayComments":false,"backgroundOpacity":0,"displayAsButton":false,"buttonSize":"big","goToSlideType":"specified","invisible":false,"solution":""},{"x":63.293973442288,"y":79.128656126482,"width":28.397120735444,"height":18.578618972332,"action":{"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","params":{"text":"<p><span style=\"font-size:0.75em;\"><em>Vincent van Gogh,&nbsp;Country road in Provence by Night,1889, May 1890,&nbsp;Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n"},"subContentId":"67e78941-2413-4cb5-bc9f-0fa1f302e0fa","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"}},"alwaysDisplayComments":false,"backgroundOpacity":0,"displayAsButton":false,"buttonSize":"big","goToSlideType":"specified","invisible":false,"solution":""}],"slideBackgroundSelector":{"fillSlideBackground":"#e8e6e7"}},{"elements":[{"x":4.0858018386108,"y":10.10101010101,"width":60.062084984678,"height":78.385416565657,"action":{"library":"H5P.ContinuousText 1.2","params":{"text":"<p>Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like <strong>Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec<\/strong> all of whom were essential for the development of modern art.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubists Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Raoul Dufy, Jean Metzinger and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism.<\/p>\n\n<p>Matisse's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.

The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called \"sfumato\", or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that \"the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Other characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera, and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.&nbsp;Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even \"the most confident master ... despair and lose heart.\"&nbsp;The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.Text 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Mona Lisa"},"subContentId":"eacad691-4ffb-4381-bbea-f5c0009402ac"}],"header":"Mona Lisa"},{"position":{"x":11,"y":58,"legacyPositioning":true},"alwaysFullscreen":false,"content":[{"params":{"text":"<p>A page showing Leonardo's study of a foetus in the womb (c.\u20091510) Royal Library,&nbsp;Windsor Castle<\/p>\n\n<p>Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water.
